Plan: Admin CRUD Page (API + Offline)
Add a new Admin page that lets you create/edit/delete properties using your existing /api/properties endpoints, styled with the existing form/button system. When the site is opened without the Express server (file:// or API unavailable), the Admin page switches to an offline mode that reads/writes the properties list in localStorage seeded from window.properties (from properties.js). Since you selected Basic Auth, protect the Admin page itself and the mutating API routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE) via HTTP Basic Auth configured with env vars.

Steps

Create the Admin page shell in admin.html by copying the shared header/nav/footer structure from an existing page like listings.html:1, then add:
A .page-header title/subtitle (pattern in pages.css:44)
A main wrapper (reuse .listings-wrapper styling pattern in pages.css:86 for padding/background)
Section A: “Existing Properties” table with columns: ID, Address, Location, Price, Type, Actions (Edit/Delete)
Section B: “Create / Edit Property” form using .form-* classes (see pages.css:324) and existing .button variants (see style.css:652)
Add Admin-specific JS in js/admin.js with an AdminPropertiesHandler.init() module that:
Detects data source:
If location.protocol is  OR /api/properties fetch fails → use offline store (localStorage)
Else → use API store (fetch calls to /api/properties)
Seeds offline store once from window.properties (available via properties.js:430)
Renders the table from the active store, wiring Edit/Delete buttons per row
Handles form submit:
Create: POST /api/properties (or offline insert)
Edit: PATCH /api/properties/:id (or offline update)
Delete: confirm + DELETE /api/properties/:id (or offline delete)
Parses the editable fields you picked:
Core: address, location, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, type
Image: image (required for create per validateCreate in propertiesStore.js:69)
Gallery: images[] (use a textarea with one path/URL per line; convert to array)
Description: description
Client-side validation to mirror the server’s required fields (show .form-error, set aria-invalid)
Extend styling in pages.css to support a minimal admin table without introducing new design tokens:
.admin-table (100% width, border, header background using existing --color-background-alt/--color-border)
.admin-actions (layout for small Edit/Delete buttons)
A compact responsive behavior (e.g., allow horizontal scroll on small screens rather than inventing a new mobile UI)
Add Basic Auth protection in server.js by introducing a small middleware (e.g., requireAdminAuth) and applying it to:
Admin static assets: GET /admin.html, GET /js/admin.js (and any admin-only assets you add)
Mutating property routes only: POST /api/properties, PATCH /api/properties/:id, DELETE /api/properties/:id
Configure credentials via environment variables ADMIN_USER and ADMIN_PASS (documented next step)
Document usage in README.md:
How to open Admin page when server is running (e.g., http://localhost:5173/admin.html)
How to set ADMIN_USER / ADMIN_PASS on Windows PowerShell/CMD
Explain offline mode behavior: edits are stored in browser localStorage and affect the Admin page only (unless later you decide to make other pages read from that same store)
Verification

Run npm run dev, open http://localhost:5173/admin.html, confirm Basic Auth prompts, then:
Create a property → appears in table and persists to properties.json
Edit a property → updates persist
Delete a property → removed persistently
Offline check: open admin.html directly (file://), confirm it loads from window.properties, then create/edit/delete and refresh → changes persist via localStorage.
Sanity: ensure the public site pages still load properties via GET /api/properties unchanged.
Decisions

Basic Auth chosen over “local-only” for clearer protection.
Admin is a single page at /admin.html (no extra routes/pages), with automatic API→offline fallback to satisfy “must work offline too.”
No nav link to Admin by default (keeps it unobtrusive); access is via direct URL.
